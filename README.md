 This is a test world that I am using. Currently it has only one scene with 3 interactable game objects.
 
 QuadCreator: creates a quad similar to the Primitive Plane object in unity
 
 PlaneCreator: creates a square meshed region with heights generated with perlin noise. There are some settings to interact with the dimensions and perlin noise.
 
 HexCreator: basically the same thing as the PlaneCreator, except the shape is a hexagon! I thought this was much cooler than a simple square shape. Hexagons are superior to        squares, an undeniable fact.
